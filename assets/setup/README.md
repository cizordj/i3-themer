# Debian bullseye

For Debian users you can run this script to resolve all required dependencies for **i3wm-themer**, it's silent and clean!

The script basically downloads, makes Debian packages and installs them into the system, this way you can remove everything later with *apt-get*

## Please notice
If you have i3 already installed via apt-get, remove it first. It also applies to compiled versions of i3-gaps where there is no package management system involved.
